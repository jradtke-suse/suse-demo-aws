# Post-Installation Integration Guide

After all products have deployed successfully (typically 15-20 minutes), follow these steps to integrate the SUSE products together for a complete demo environment.

## Prerequisites

- All three product modules deployed successfully:
  - Rancher Manager
  - SUSE Observability
  - SUSE Security (NeuVector)
- Access credentials for each product UI
- All services are accessible via their URLs

---

## Overview of Integration Steps

1. **Configure Rancher Manager TLS Settings** - Update certificate validation mode
2. **Add Rancher Manager to SUSE Observability** - Monitor the Rancher cluster
3. **Add Observability Cluster to Rancher Manager** - Manage from central location
4. **Add Security Cluster to Rancher Manager** - Centralized management
5. **Add Observability Cluster to SUSE Observability** - Monitor the observability platform itself
6. **Add Security Cluster to SUSE Observability** - Monitor the security platform

---

## 1. Configure Rancher Manager TLS Settings

First, update Rancher Manager to trust system certificates for agent communication.

### Steps:
1. Login to **Rancher Manager UI**
2. Click the **globe icon** in the lower left-hand corner
3. Navigate to **Settings**
4. Scroll down and find **"agent-tls-mode"**
5. Change the value to **"System Store"**
6. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:** This allows Rancher agents to properly validate TLS certificates when connecting to the Rancher server.

## 2. Add Rancher Manager to SUSE Observability

Integrate the Rancher Manager cluster with SUSE Observability for monitoring.

### Steps:

#### 2.1 Access Both UIs
1. Login to **SUSE Observability Dashboard** (should default to StackPacks UI)
2. In another tab, login to **Rancher Manager**
3. In Rancher, navigate to the **local** cluster
4. Click the **Kubectl Shell** button (upper right corner)

#### 2.2 Create Service Token in Observability
1. In the **SUSE Observability UI**, search for **"rancher"** in the StackPacks search
2. Select the **Rancher** StackPack
3. Click **CREATE NEW SERVICE TOKEN**
4. Click **COPY TO CLIPBOARD** at the bottom of the dialog

#### 2.3 Install Agent on Rancher Cluster
1. Go back to the **Rancher Kubectl Shell**
2. Paste the recently copied commands from Observability
3. Press Enter to execute

#### 2.4 Install Generic Kubernetes StackPack
1. Go back to **SUSE Observability UI**
2. Search for and select **"Generic Kubernetes (including RKE2)"** StackPack
3. Copy the commands from **Section 1** (Create Service Token) - paste into Kubectl Shell
4. Copy the commands from **Section 2** (Deploy Agent) - paste into Kubectl Shell
5. Execute both sets of commands

### Verify Integration:
```bash
# In Rancher Kubectl Shell, check agent deployment
kubectl get pods -n stackstate

# Wait for pods to be running
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=stackstate-agent -n stackstate --timeout=300s
```

**Result:** Rancher Manager cluster now appears in SUSE Observability dashboard with full topology and metrics.

   terraform output -raw ssh_command
   # Or manually:
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/suse-demo-aws.pem ec2-user@<observability-ip>
   ```
3. Switch to root:
   ```bash
   sudo su -
   ```
4. Paste and execute the Rancher registration commands
5. Monitor the agent deployment:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n cattle-system -w
   ```

### Verify Integration:
Wait for all cattle-system pods to be Running, then check in Rancher UI:
- The observability cluster should appear in **Cluster Management**
- Cluster state should show as **Active**

## 4. Add Security Cluster to Rancher Manager

Import the SUSE Security (NeuVector) cluster into Rancher.

### Steps:

#### 4.1 Initiate Import in Rancher
1. In **Rancher Manager UI**, click **Cluster Management**
2. Click **Import Existing** (upper right)
3. Select **Generic**
4. Enter cluster details:
   - **Cluster Name:** `security`
   - **Description:** `SUSE Security (NeuVector) Cluster`
5. Click **Create**

#### 4.2 Apply Registration to Security Cluster
1. Copy the first set of kubectl commands from Rancher
2. SSH to the **Security node**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/suse-demo-aws.pem ec2-user@<security-ip>
   ```
3. Switch to root:
   ```bash
   sudo su -
   ```
