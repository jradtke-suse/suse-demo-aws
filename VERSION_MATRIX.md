# Compatibility Matrix

This is not accurate yet (it is a placeholder that will be populated later)

While many parts of my Demo are "latest" and un-versioned, I thought it was a good idea to keep track of what versions all work
together and successfully deploy

| date       | AMI-ID            | OS          | Kubernetes | Rancher | Observability | Security  | cert-manager |
|:-----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------|---------------|-----------|:-------------|
